# Implementing Binary Tree in Rust

In this blog post, I'll walk you through how to implement a simple binary tree in Rust. Binary trees are fundamental data structures that are useful for organizing hierarchical data. Let's dive into the implementation!

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here's a basic structure of a binary tree:
